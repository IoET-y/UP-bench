# AUVControl
Control of a hovering AUV simulated using HoloOcean. This implements the full robotics stack 
include various algorithms for state estimation, low-level control, and planning. HoloOcean is simple
to use, and the HoveringAUV is easy to control, making this a perfect platform for experimenting and 
testing of various AUV path planning algorithms.

The completed version of this Repository is under construction, will be prepared in one week!
