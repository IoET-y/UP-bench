## Overview
**UP-Bench** is an open-source benchmarking platform for **underwater path planning** algorithms, providing a **unified evaluation framework**, **automated performance assessment**, and **reproducible experimental workflows**. Built on the **HoloOcean** simulation platform, UP-Bench incorporates realistic underwater dynamics, including:
- 🌊 **Ocean currents**
- 🏗️ **Static and dynamic obstacles**
- 📡 **Sensor models**

The benchmark supports a wide range of **path planning algorithms**, including:
- **Classical algorithms**: A*, Dijkstra, RRT
- **Evolutionary methods**: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Hybrid SAC+A*+LQR

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **3D underwater path planning** with realistic dynamics and ocean currents  
✅ **Standardized evaluation metrics**: Path efficiency, success rate, collision rate, energy consumption, computational cost  
✅ **Automated benchmarking tools** for systematic algorithm comparisons  
✅ **Modular API** allowing easy integration of new algorithms
